# Project-4-c-game-of-life

## Description

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in C. It was developed as part of a school assignment to deepen our understanding of key C programming concepts. Through this project, we learned how to:

- Create and organize a custom C library.
- Link multiple C files using header files.
- Use a Makefile to manage the build process.
- Practice working with embedded lists and pointers to handle and pass data efficiently.


### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you'll need:

- 'gcc' (C compiler).
- `make` (for utilizing the provided Makefile).

### Steps

1. Save all of the files in the "Game of Life in C" folder

2. Compile the project using the Makefile:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

Once compiled, you can view the output with:

```bash
./conway.out
