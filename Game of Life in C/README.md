# Project-4-c-game-of-life

## Description

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in C. It was developed as part of a school assignment to deepen our understanding of key C programming concepts. Through this project, we learned how to:

- Create and organize a custom C library.
- Link multiple C files using header files.
- Use a Makefile to manage the build process.
- Practice working with embedded lists and pointers to handle and pass data efficiently.


### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you'll need:

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
- `make` (for utilizing the provided Makefile).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project-4-c-game-of-life.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Project-4-c-game-of-life
    ```

3. Compile the project using the Makefile:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage
