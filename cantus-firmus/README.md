<br>Description:
<br>In music there is a tool that was created
<br>to help composers write simple melodies
<br>and harmonies. An example of this is called
<br>Cantus Firmus, eight whole notes that resemble
<br>a simple melody without any rhythmic distinction.
<br>
<br>When looking to write melody within my own music,
<br>I decided it would be fun if I could code a way
<br>to generate a cantus firmus that way I could 
<br>write meoldies with ease. 
<br>
<br>I realize this may be a trivial thing to code, as
<br>the code already esxists, but I thought it was a
<br>fun way incorporate music into my computer science
<br>studies. 
<br> 
<br>I attempted to generate harmony as well, but never
<br>quite finished it, so in its present state it can
<br>only generate a cantus firmus.
